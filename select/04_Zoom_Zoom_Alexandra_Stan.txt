Gimme gimme
Gimme
Tonight we're gonna fall in love,
Tonight I wanna tell you something
You're everything I'm dreaming of
Oh yeah, ooh oh yeah
I can see it when you look in my eyes
I can feel it, I wanna take you for a drive
Let's make it onto the backseat, baby
Oh yeah, ooh oh yeah

I'm mysterious, I'm so furious
I wanna get to know your heart
(Don't play your game, don't play your game)
I want the two of us to get serious
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you're waiting for?!
(So, what you say, what you saaaay?)
Let me take you on a ride!

You got to kick it kick it
Catch me on the rewind
Whip it, whip it
Tell me on the countdown
Zoom zoom zoom zoom
Gimme gimme
Boom boom boom boom
La la la la, crack it on the speaker
Higher higher, we gon' sleep on
Zoom zoom zoom zoom
Gimme gimme
Boom boom boom boom
We go zoom zoom

I like them to take the lead,
We're cruising into the full-moon rising
I'll let you get behind the wheel
Say oh yeah, ooh oh yeah
And when we're driving just put your hand in my hand,
The stars are shinning
I want you say you'll be my man
Enjoy me in the backseat baby!
Oh yeah, ooh oh yeah

I'm mysterious, I'm so furious
I wanna get to know your heart
(Don't play your game, don't play your game)
I want the two of us to get serious
Tell me what you're waiting for,
What you're waiting for?!
(So, what you say, what you saaaay?)
Let me take you on a ride!
